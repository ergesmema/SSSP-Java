# SSSP-Java (Single Source Shortest Paths)
A java implementation that introduces a way to find single source shortest paths from a given node to other nodes in the graph. The program works for both directed acyclic graphs(DAGs) as well as for directed graphs that include cycles. The input is given via a pre-validated text file written by the user, which contains the number of vertexes, number of edges and a list of edges and their weights, as well as comments if needed which are denoted by the hash sign(#) at the beginning of line. This information is read and processed, in order to determine the type of graph and to output the shortest paths from the given source node.
